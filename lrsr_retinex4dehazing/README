Light Random Sprays Retinex
===========================


Light Random Sprays Retinex is a simple image enhancing program for 
removing the local color cast of the scene illumination source and 
adjusting the brightness of a given image. The program itself represents 
a very good and fast approximation of the Random Sprays Retinex (RSR)
algorithm providing resulting images in much less time and with more 
quality. It also allows the stronger effects of to be applied since it 
removes the RSR resulting noise. The program is based on the paper 
mentioned in the Literature section.

The program needs OpenCV library for image reading and simple 
processing. For compilation on Linux, the program also needs pkg-config.
